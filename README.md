# Ray Tracer Mini
A simple ray tracer written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) following the [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) book by Peter Shirley.

The ray tracer generates a random scene filled with spheres and leverages [Rayon](https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon) to deliver parallel computations.
